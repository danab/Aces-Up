# Aces Up (Idiot's Delight)

A simple solitaire card game created for my grandmother and her iPad. Playable version here: [http://acesup.danaben.net/t](http://acesup.danaben.net/t)

A version of the rules can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aces_Up). This app has two versions: *easy* and *hard*. The only difference between the version is on *easy* you can remove cards if they are placed directly upon a higher card of the same suit.
